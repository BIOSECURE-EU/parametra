Ticks pass coxiellosis from an infected to a susceptible animal through a bite. The faecal matter can also contain coxiellosis, thus contaminating the environment and spreading the disease. First, a nonlinear integer order mathematical model is developed to represent the spread of this infectious disease in livestock. The proposed integer model investigates the positivity and boundedness, disease equilibria, basic reproduction number, bifurcation, and sensitivity analysis. Through mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, it shows that if the environmental transmission and the effective shedding rate of coxiella burnetii into the environment by both asymptomatic and symptomatic livestock are zero, then the usual threshold hold and it produces forward bifurcation. It is noticed that an increase in the recruitment rate of ticks produces backward bifurcation.","Asamoah et al., 2022","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2022.111821","AA"

A total of 2552 swine farms in Ontario province were allocated to each census division of Ontario and geo-locations of the farms were randomly generated within the agriculture land of each Census Division. Contact rates among different production types were obtained using pig movement information from four regions in Canada. A total of 24 scenarios were developed involving various direct (movement of infected animals) and indirect (pig transportation trucks) contact parameters in combination with alternating the production type of the farm in which the infection was seeded.

The results of this study, through numerical analysis of the multiscale model, show that superinfection influences the dynamics of paratuberculosis only at the start of the infection, while the MAP bacteria replication continuously influences paratuberculosis dynamics throughout the infection until the host recovers from the initial infectious episode. This is largely because the replication of MAP bacteria at the within-host scale sustains the dynamics of paratuberculosis at this scale domain. We further use the embedded multiscale model developed in this study to . evaluate the comparative effectiveness of paratuberculosis health interventions that influence the disease dynamics at different scales from efficacy data.","Netshikwet and Garira, 2021","https://doi.org/10.1155%2F2021%2F9919700","AA"

A follow-up study was carried out in 3 selected farms known to be affected by repeated influenza infections.

Piglets were monitored individually on a monthly basis for serology and clinical parameters. When a flu outbreak occurred, daily virological and clinical investigations were carried out for two weeks. Influenza outbreaks, confirmed by influenza A virus detection, were reported at least once in each batch.
