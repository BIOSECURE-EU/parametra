First, we quantified the reproduction ratio R for the various groups using a final-size method. Our final-size results predicted that vaccination with a four-fold vaccine dose (but not with a single dose) at 1 week before inoculation (−7 dpi) would reduce R compared to the non-vaccinated group.

Secondly, we used the daily results of virus excretion to quantify the transmission rate β (by using generalized linear modelling), and the infectious period T (by using survival analysis). We used the estimates of β and T to estimate R more precisely as compared to the final-size method and also for the groups for which a finite estimate could not be obtained using a final-size method. Our modelling results predicted that β for non-vaccinated, for single-dose and four-fold-dose groups would be 6.1 (3.7, 10) day−1, 2.0 (1.0, 4.0) day−1 and 0.4 (0.1, 1.4) day−1, T at 6.5 (5.7, 7.3), 5.3 (4.7, 6.0) and 2.3 (0.9, 5.7) days and R at 40 (21, 74), 11 (4.9, 24) and 1.0 (0.1, 7.8), respectively. These results predicted that both vaccination with a four-fold vaccine dose and with a single dose at −7 dpi would reduce β, T and R significantly as compared to the non-vaccinated pigs, thereby showing that vaccination will reduce transmission of FMDV significantly already 1 week post vaccination.","Eble et al., 2008","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2007.06.004","AA"

Seven successive transmission trials involving a total of 77 specific pathogen-free piglets were carried out from 7 to 63 days post-inoculation (dpi). A semi-quantitative real time RT-PCR was developed to assess the evolution of the viral genome load in blood and nasal swabs from inoculated and contact pigs, with time. Virus genome in blood was detectable in inoculated pigs from 7 to 77 dpi, whereas viral genome shedding was detectable from nasal swabs from 2 to 48 dpi. The infectiousness of inoculated pigs, assessed from the frequency of occurrence of infected pigs in susceptible groups in each contact trial, increased from 7 to 14 dpi and then decreased slowly until 42 dpi (3, 7, 2, 1 and 0 pigs infected at 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 dpi, respectively). These data were used to model the time-dependent infectiousness by a lognormal-like function with a latency period of 1 day and led to an estimated basic reproduction ratio, R0 of 2.6 [1.8, 3.3].

A follow-up study was carried out in 3 selected farms known to be affected by repeated influenza infections. Three batches of pigs were followed within each farm from birth to slaughter through a representative sample of 40 piglets per batch. Piglets were monitored individually on a monthly basis for serology and clinical parameters. When a flu outbreak occurred, daily virological and clinical investigations were carried out for two weeks. Influenza outbreaks, confirmed by influenza A virus detection, were reported at least once in each batch. These outbreaks occurred at a constant age within farms and were correlated with an increased frequency of sneezing and coughing fits. H1N1 and H1N2 viruses from European enzootic subtypes and reassortants between viruses from these lineages were consecutively and sometimes simultaneously identified depending on the batch, suggesting virus co-circulations at the farm, batch and sometimes individual levels.","Rose et al., 2013","https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-44-72","AA"
