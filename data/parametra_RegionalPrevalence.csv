This study comprises the application of environmental sampling within a herd prevalence estimation study in German dairy herds. Based on regional differences in the structure of livestock farming, Germany was divided into three regions where a representative number of farms were visited for sample collection. The results clearly indicate a different regional MAP herd level prevalence. The highest percentage of affected herds is found in the eastern part with large dairy herds, and the lowest in the south with the smallest average herd size.

From each batch, a composite sample of 10 caecal contents (n = 358) and 5 neck skins (n = 1790) were collected and numbers of Campylobacter in each sample were determined. Of the 1790 neck skin samples tested, 53% were Campylobacter positive. Campylobacter was detected in the caecal contents of 66% of all batches tested. Depopulation and/or age had a significant effect on Campylobacter prevalence with 67% of final thin broilers yielding Campylobacter-positive neck skin samples in contrast to 38% of first thin broilers that yielded positive neck skin samples (P ≤ 0.002).","Lynch et al., 2022","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2022.109693","AA"
