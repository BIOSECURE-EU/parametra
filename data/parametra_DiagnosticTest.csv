The comparative study panel comprised 83 archived DNA samples from African Swine Fever virus (African Swine FeverV) clinical samples, belonging to five different genotypes from outbreaks in 16 countries in Asia and Africa. The analytical specificity was assessed against a panel of swine pathogens. The LOD ranged from 13 to 41 gene copies per reaction; VetMax ™ African Swine Fever Detection Kit from Applied Biosystems exhibited the lowest detection limit (13 gene copies per reaction) and iQ Supermix from Bio-Rad the highest detection limit (41 gene copies per reaction).","Auer et al., 2022","https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.14491","AA"

To detect African Swine FeverV, three different PCRs were evaluated in parallel using 785 field and experimental samples. The results showed almost perfect agreement between the Universal ProbeLibrary (UPL-PCR) and the real-time (κ = 0.94 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.91 to 0.97]) and conventional (κ = 0.88 [95% CI, 0.83 to 0.92]) World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)-prescribed PCRs. The UPL-PCR had greater diagnostic sensitivity for detecting survivors and allows earlier detection of the disease. Compared to the commercial antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), good-to-moderate agreement (κ = 0.67 [95% CI, 0.58 to 0.76]) was obtained, with a sensitivity of 77.2% in the commercial test. For African Swine Fever antibody detection, five serological methods were tested, including three commercial ELISAs, the OIE-ELISA, and the confirmatory immunoperoxidase test (IPT).","Gallardo et al., 2015","https://doi.org/10.1128%2FJCM.00857-15","AA"

We present the calculated values of the test accuracies, the estimated proportion of antibody-positive animals and the dependency structure for both datasets. Different starting values led to matching results for the entire dataset. For the vaccinated subgroup, the results were more dependent on the selected starting values.

A total of 313 well-defined sera from SIV seronegative pigs and pigs experimentally infected with European SIVs were used to compare the performance of both ELISAs and the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. The ELISAs largely failed to detect pigs that had been infected with H1N1 (0/42 positive in H1N1 ELISA) or H3N2 only (9/18 positive in H3N2 ELISA; group 1). Higher ELISA detection rates were found after consecutive infection of pigs with either H1N1 or H3N2 and 1 other subtype (7/40 and 11/22 positive in H1N1 and H3N2 ELISA, respectively; group 2). Of 39 pigs that had been vaccinated twice with 1 of 4 commercial SIV vaccines (group 3), 25 tested positive in the H1N1 and 4 in the H3N2 ELISA. Pigs that had received a single vaccination after a prior infection with H1N1 and/or H3N2 (group 4) were more frequently positive than group 1 or 3 pigs (23/24 and 15/24 positive in H1N1 and H3N2 ELISA, respectively).
