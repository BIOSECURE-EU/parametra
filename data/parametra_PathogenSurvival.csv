Inactivation of the virus in the environment depends on factors such as temperature, pH, light, and humidity. At 4°C, the virus is stable for 1 month. BHV-1 is inactivated at 56°C within 21 minutes, at 37°C within 10 days and at 22°C within 50 days (Gibbs & Rweyemamu Citation1977). The virus may survive for more than 30 days in feed. As the virus is enveloped, it is sensitive to organic solvents such as chloroform, ether, and acetone. The virus is sensitive to many Disinfection and is readily inactivated by 0.5% NaOH, 0.01% HgCl2, 1% chlorinated lime, 1% phenolic derivatives, 1% quaternary ammonium bases, and 10% Lugol's iodine.

To maximize study power, scale models (1:150) of weaned-pig trailers were constructed that provided an animal density equal to that of an actual weaned-pig trailer capable of transporting 300 pigs. The 1st aim involved contaminating the interior of the model trailers with various concentrations (101 to 104 TCID50/mL) of PRBovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus MN 30–100, then housing sentinel pigs in the trailers for 2 h. Pigs exposed to trailers contaminated with ≥ 103 TCID50/mL became infected. The 2nd aim involved housing experimentally infected seeder pigs in trailers for 2 h, then directly introducing sentinel pigs for 2 h. Infection of sentinels was demonstrated in 3 of 4 replicates. The 3rd aim involved applying 1 of 4 sanitation procedures (treatments) to contaminated trailers. Treatment 1 consisted of manual scraping of the interior to remove soiled bedding (wood chips). Treatment 2 consisted of bedding removal, washing (80°C, 20 500 kPa), and disinfecting (with 1:256 phenol; 10-min contact time). Treatment 3 consisted of treatment 2, followed by freezing and thawing. Treatment 4 consisted of bedding removal, washing, disinfecting, and drying. Ten replicates were conducted per treatment.

The stability of Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus on stainless steel discs was assessed and its inactivation by different surface Disinfection (EN16777) investigated.","Meister et al., 2023","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2023.08.009","AA"

Inactivation of the virus in the environment depends on factors such as temperature, pH, light, and humidity. At 4°C, the virus is stable for 1 month. BHV-1 is inactivated at 56°C within 21 minutes, at 37°C within 10 days and at 22°C within 50 days. The virus may survive for more than 30 days in feed. The virus is sensitive to many Disinfection and is readily inactivated by 0.5% NaOH, 0.01% HgCl2, 1% chlorinated lime, 1% phenolic derivatives, 1% quaternary ammonium bases, and 10% Lugol's iodine.
