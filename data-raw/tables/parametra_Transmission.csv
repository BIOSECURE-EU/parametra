Ticks pass coxiellosis from an infected to a susceptible animal through a bite. The faecal matter can also contain coxiellosis, thus contaminating the environment and spreading the disease. First, a nonlinear integer order mathematical model is developed to represent the spread of this infectious disease in livestock. The proposed integer model investigates the positivity and boundedness, disease equilibria, basic reproduction number, bifurcation, and sensitivity analysis. Through mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, it shows that if the environmental transmission and the effective shedding rate of coxiella burnetii into the environment by both asymptomatic and symptomatic livestock are zero, then the usual threshold hold and it produces forward bifurcation. It is noticed that an increase in the recruitment rate of ticks produces backward bifurcation.","Asamoah et al., 2022",2022,"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2022.111821","AA","10.1016/j.chaos.2022.111821","Asamoah et al., 2022",FALSE

This is largely because the replication of MAP bacteria at the within-host scale sustains the dynamics of paratuberculosis at this scale domain.
