The analytical specificity was assessed against a panel of swine pathogens. The LOD ranged from 13 to 41 gene copies per reaction; VetMax ™ African Swine Fever Detection Kit from Applied Biosystems exhibited the lowest detection limit (13 gene copies per reaction) and iQ Supermix from Bio-Rad the highest detection limit (41 gene copies per reaction).","Auer et al., 2022",2022,"https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.14491","AA"

To detect African Swine FeverV, three different PCRs were evaluated in parallel using 785 field and experimental samples. The results showed almost perfect agreement between the Universal ProbeLibrary (UPL-PCR) and the real-time (κ = 0.94 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.91 to 0.97]) and conventional (κ = 0.88 [95% CI, 0.83 to 0.92]) World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)-prescribed PCRs. The UPL-PCR had greater diagnostic sensitivity for detecting survivors and allows earlier detection of the disease. Compared to the commercial antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), good-to-moderate agreement (κ = 0.67 [95% CI, 0.58 to 0.76]) was obtained, with a sensitivity of 77.2% in the commercial test. For African Swine Fever antibody detection, five serological methods were tested, including three commercial ELISAs, the OIE-ELISA, and the confirmatory immunoperoxidase test (IPT).","Gallardo et al., 2015",2015,"https://doi.org/10.1128%2FJCM.00857-15","AA"
