the current control strategies, including chemotherapy and vaccination, in
selected countries in Europe are described. In some countries, disease control
is hampered by excessively strict veterinary legislation which discourages
farmers and private veterinarians from notifying outbreaks because it leads
to the prohibition of milk sales and can result in delays in lifting restrictions. In
addition, new European Union legislation may downgrade the importance of CA,
which will have implications for international research efforts. Finally, a series of
recommendations are provided that cover the proper notification and handling
of CA outbreaks, including movement control, current diagnostics, treatment,
vaccination and disinfection","Loria et al., 2019",2019,"https://doc.woah.org/dyn/portal/digidoc.xhtml?statelessToken=8v61Z-kpQjDKruXYnML8727NLCLHP_vdUyw37edKDFA=&actionMethod=dyn%2Fportal%2Fdigidoc.xhtml%3AdownloadAttachment.openStateless","AA"
