We used six groups of four lambs each, in which half of each group was inoculated and the other half was contact-exposed. To quantify the effectiveness of a single vaccination we also included six groups of four lambs each, vaccinated with O Manisa vaccine, 14 days prior to inoculation. Oropharyngeal fluid was obtained with a swab (OPF-swab), and blood samples were collected daily to determine virus excretion and serological response. We calculated the transmission rate β (the number of new infections per day per infectious animal), and the reproduction ratio R (the number of secondary infections caused by one infectious individual). The mean daily virus excretion and the number of days the lambs excreted virus in the OPF differed significantly between vaccinated and non-vaccinated lambs.","Orsel et al., 2007",2007,"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.11.048","AA"
